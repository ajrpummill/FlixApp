### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I had trouble with the CocoaPods because this is my first introduction to them. Also navigating GitHub is a first for me as well, but I glad this course requires it, as now I understand it seems to be an industry standard. I admit it was alot of following along with the video to get things rolling, but I am learing alot and I am excited to learn more about development! 

Another odd thing happened when I was first attempting to do this assigment and I had to start completly over. It kept giving me a "Succeeded" message on the build but wouldn't allow the App to open on any simulator or device. I am not sure what the error was exactly but I believe it had somthing to do with the AppDelegate.swift file. I deleted the project completly, restarted my computer and Xcode and started over and when I went to build and run it magically worked. It all went pretty smooth from there after.
